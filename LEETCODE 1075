1075. Project Employees I
Intuition
We need to join the tables as the experience_years column is not directly related to project_id.

Approach
As seen from the given input and output from the example, the second column in the output called average_years is calculated using the data of the column named experience_years.
Since we want the average experience years of all the employees project wise, we will need the experience years correlating to the project_id, but it is not given directly in the problem description.
So we will use the JOIN Operation to join the tables so that we can have the experience_years related to the project_id with the help of the employee_id column.
If you didn't understand it, don't worry; I will explain it to you step by step.

The table we get after using :

FROM Project p LEFT JOIN Employee e
ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id

We will then be using the GROUP BY operation :

GROUP BY p.project_id
As we use the 'GROUP BY' operation the average will be calculated automatically as shown below.

SOLUTION :--
SELECT p.project_id, ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years),2) AS average_years
FROM Project p 
LEFT JOIN Employee e
ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id
